This project is intended to be used as a method of visualizing Community Health Advocacy (CHA) and Jump Applied Research in Community Health through Engineering and Simulation (ARCHES) datasets of supported projects to draw important conclusions on sources of success in these programs, as well as places in which improvements could be made or further funding could be added.

The user manual and documentation can also be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1He0BBYZSRV2i9Iy7QSXhTLiCiSnI_biw/view?usp=sharing)

Forked from [ARCHES Data Visualization](https://github.com/AmosLab/arches-data-visualization/)

This project uses the [D3 force-directed graph](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) layout created by Mike Bostock.
